# N-body-Simulations

Welcome to my N-body simulation! This repository contains code and a simple animation for a direct N-body simulation that I built. I used it for an in-depth analysis of long-term orbital prcession of satellites in an Earth-Moon-satellite system.

## Key Features
- Parallel computing when N > 500
- Conservation of energy and angular momentum confirmed for each simulation run
- Leapfrog integration, sympletic and stable
- Support for analysis with Matplotlib
- Support for animation with VPython
